Re-enable forceSync=true and fix tests

Fix calls to update that are not properly synchronized. See:
  cli.js: Requisition.exec (2 instances)
  testKeyboard.js: check (see TODO)

Remove the util.synchronize in selectiontype.increment/decrement
  Which probably means making increment/decrement completely async

Requisition.setAssignment
  why is the argUpdate default the thing you should not do?

We're caching many of the async selections.
  (I think, because tests run very quickly otherwise)

s/setup: '/setup:    '/g


helpers:

- Work out why/if test failures are happening being logged in wrong places
- Move gcli/host, gcli/l10n, gcli/legacy, gcli/promise, gcli/util, and
    gcli/ui/domtemplate to util/*
    So the test harness can use them, which means promise based tests
- Add 'if' support to helpers.audit
- Make 'check' optional
