# Notes on outstanding work ...

Fix calls to update that are not properly synchronized. See:
  cli.js: Requisition.exec (2 instances)
  testKeyboard.js: check (see TODO)

Remove the util.synchronize in selectiontype.increment/decrement
  Which probably means making increment/decrement completely async

Requisition.setAssignment
  why is the argUpdate default the thing you should not do?

Allow DelegateType to see other type values

helpers:
- Add 'if' support to helpers.audit
