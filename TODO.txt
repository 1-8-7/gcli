Notes on outstanding work ...

Convert tests that use helpers.exec to use helpers.audit
  testTooltip rewrite framework
  testInputter rewite framework
  testHelp remove helpers.exec (and search for others)

helpers.js
  Work out why/if test failures are happening being logged in wrong places

Fix calls to update that are not properly synchronized. See:
  cli.js: Requisition.exec (2 instances)
  testKeyboard.js: check (see TODO)

Remove the util.synchronize in selectiontype.increment/decrement
Which probably means making increment/decrement completely async

Requisition.setAssignment
  why is the argUpdate default the thing you should not do?

We're caching many of the async selections. We need to find a way to not do that

s/setup: '/setup:    '/g

Move gcli/host, gcli/l10n, gcli/legacy, gcli/promise, gcli/util, and
  gcli/ui/domtemplate to util/*
