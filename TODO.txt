Notes on outstanding work ...

Make selection always async, and re-test

Fix calls to update that are not properly synchronized. See:
  cli.js: Requisition.complete (see TODO towards end)
  cli.js: Requisition.exec (2 instances)
  testKeyboard.js: check (see TODO)

Make exec return a promise and follow through call sites

Remove the util.synchronize in selectiontype.increment/decrement
Which probably means making increment/decrement completely async
