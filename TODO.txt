Notes on outstanding work ...

Make selection always async, and re-test

Fix calls to update that are not properly synchronized. See:
  cli.js: Requisition.exec (2 instances)
  testKeyboard.js: check (see TODO)

Convert tests that use helpers.exec to use helpers.audit

Remove the util.synchronize in selectiontype.increment/decrement
Which probably means making increment/decrement completely async
